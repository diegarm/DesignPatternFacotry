What is the Observer Design Pattern? ðŸ¤” 

How do you think you could implement it?

The Observer Pattern is useful when you have a "single source of truth" that multiple other components need to be in sync with.

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

The pattern essentially establishes a broadcast mechanism where the "subject" broadcasts updates, and the "observers" receive these updates.

I create a simple C# example that illustrates the Observer pattern using the weather station scenario. You can check it below.
