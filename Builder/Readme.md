Imagine you're a millionaire and you want a personalized house. 

You'll face the Builder Pattern. ðŸ‘‡ 

By definition:

The Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern that is used to construct a complex object step by step. 
It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing you to create different variations of an object by using the same construction process.

Real-world example:

Imagine you're a custom home builder who creates personalized houses. 

Each client has specific desires for their ideal home, from the number of bedrooms to the presence of a garage, or the inclusion of luxurious amenities. 

Traditional construction processes often struggle to efficiently accommodate these varied demands. This is where the Builder design pattern steps in as a solution.

To address this, you begin by creating a House class that serves as the blueprint for the final product. 

To streamline the construction process, you introduce the HouseBuilder interface, which defines methods for configuring different aspects of the house.

Take a look at the slides below, you can see the example, code implementation, and pros and cons.

This is directly from my new ebook Design Patter Simplified I released a couple of weeks ago. There are 9 more design patterns explained similarly.
