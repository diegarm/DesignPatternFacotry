What is the Chain Responsibility Pattern?

When should I implement it?
How to implement it?

The Chain of Responsibility Pattern allows us to easily separate dependent parts to make code more extensible and testable.

In simple words, we can say that the chain of responsibility design pattern creates a chain of receiver objects for a given request.

In this design pattern, normally each receiver contains a reference to another receiver. If one receiver cannot handle the request then it passes the same request to the next receiver and so on. One receiver handles the request in the chain or one or more receivers handle the request.

I explained and implemented it in my newsletter issue. If you are interested in learning how it works, check it out here: https://lnkd.in/duiRscpY
