Adapter Design Pattern - Simplifed💡

Definition:

The adapter pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. The adapter lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

Real-Wolrd Analogy:

• Stefan from Serbia arrived in the UK.
• Stefan has a classic EU charger with a two-part outlet.
• The UK has a standard three-part plug.

How will Stefan charge his phone?

Answer: By using an adapter.

The adapter creates the possibility of connecting two different interfaces 
(2 plugs). 
It gets one type of input and produces a different type of output.

When to use:

• Ado .Net SqlAdapter, MySqlAdapter
• Allow a system to use classes of another system that is incompatible with it.
