Do you love coffee? With what flavors?

Let's create it with a Decorator pattern â˜• 

The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to add new functionalities to an existing object without altering its structure. 
It involves a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components. 

For example: making a coffee. 

At its core, you might have a simple beverage like "Just a coffee" (my way).
However, you can also have variations like a coffee with milk, a coffee with whipped cream, a coffee with chocolate, etc. 

Instead of creating distinct subclasses for each combination, you can use the Decorator Pattern to "decorate" your coffee with add-ons. ðŸ‘‡ 

When to use the Decorator pattern?

â€¢ Large Number of Features: 
Instead of having a separate subclass for each combination, you can "mix and match" with decorators. 
 
â€¢ Single Responsibilityï»¿ Principle: 
It allows you to divide a class that has several responsibilities into several smaller classes.

â€¢ To Avoid Modification: 
If you have an existing class, and you want to add new functionalities without modifying it, then the decorator is a good choice.

â€¢ Replacing Multiple Inheritance: 
C# doesn't support multiple inheritance. If you're trying to add functionalities from several sources to a single class, then using a decorator might be a good alternative.
